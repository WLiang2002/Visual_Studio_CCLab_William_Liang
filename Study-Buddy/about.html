    <h1>About this Website</h1>
  
    <p>
        This website will provide you with an animated figure who will act as a "Study Buddy". 
        <br>
        <br>

        The figure is just like a little virtual companion that is working alongisde with the user.
    There are also clocks that will display different timezones. If you play some music from the spotify player, both you and your buddy can listen to some tunes as well.

    Why a Beaver and a Panda?

    <br>
    <br>    
    <br>
    <br>
    The reasons why I chose these two animals is due to my location and the school's location. I am currently
    in Canada, therefore choosing the beaver which is Canada's national animal. The Panda signifies the national animal of China, which is also where NYU Shanghai is located.
    In another sense, it can also be seen that choosing the Beaver would be studying with me, and choosing the Panda would be studying with the students in China.
